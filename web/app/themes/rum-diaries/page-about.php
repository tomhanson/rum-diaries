            <p>
                <em>Tiles</em> was designed to be lightweight, interactive, and highly performant. jQuery isn't even included!
            <p>As expected, all your content is SEO-optimized and fine-tuned for
                <strong>
                    <em>any</em>
                </strong> device; include smartphones, tablets, laptops, retina screens, 5K monitors, and even TVs!
            <p>
                <em>Tiles</em> also comes packed with a dozen features that make Tiles theme truly unique:
                <ul>
                    <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Fully-functional Contact Form</strong>
                <br>In less than 10 seconds, you can have a fully-functional contact form that
                <strong>catches spam</strong> and
                <strong>self-validates</strong>!
                <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Cutting-edge Animations</strong>
                <br>As much as we all love animations, they can quickly become "overkill". Not here! All animations are chosen carefully
                and will always run at a
                <u>silky smooth 60 fps</u>.
                <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Lightweight Codebase</strong>
                <br>

                <br>
                <em>Tiles</em> comes with extensive documentation, plus its source code is also well-commented to guide readers
                through each function. See something missing? Let me know!
                <li>
            <p>

                <br>SASS allows for clear and concise organization of CSS through variables and mixins. This means that
                you can
                <u>change the
                    <em>whole look</em>
                </u> with just a few values!

                <strong>Browserify Modules</strong>
                <br>All of the JavaScript comes in clearly defined
                <em>modules</em>, which is an organization-lover's dream! If you want to turn off or adjust a feature,
                you know
                <strong>exactly</strong> what module to tweak or remove.

                <strong>Included Build Tools</strong>
                <br>Unlike most themes,
                <em>Tiles</em> gives you the
                <u>original source code</u>
                <strong>and</strong> the
                <u>original build tools</u> used to create it! This allows you to develop and adjust
                <em>Tiles</em>
                <strong>with confidence</strong>.
                <li>

                <br>Include maps wherever you'd like, even
                <u>multiple on the same page</u>, without adjusting a template file!
                <li>
            <p>
